<h1>The Best Movies According to Gaspar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sideways 2004</h3>
<p>Paul Giamatti had one of his best performances here. The scene where he drinks the wine from a paper cup was the height.</p>
<h3>The Time Traveler's Wife</h3>
<p>Travel through time made inteligently.</p>
<h3>The Book of Eli</h3>
<p>Not a great story but Denzel Washington carried the whole movie on his back.</p>
